For a long time, I have used MS Word when I had to write a publication, with all the hassles of copy-pasting statistical results, tables, and visualizations. 
Of course, I was aware of R markdown, but I did not use it because of two main reasons. First, because my collaborators did not want to give up their good old practices. And second, because handling citations in R markdown seemed to be more cumbersome, compared to MS Word. 
Let me explain. I order to include citations in R markdown, you have to have a BibTeX file that you can generate manually from Mendeley. Then you have to read that file in R, using ....
Then you can use the citr package, and R Studio will provide a pretty straightforward interface to find and easily cite your references. So, my problem was the manual generation of the BibTeX file, because doing that each time when I add a new article to Mendeley would mean a lot of additional friction. 

However, I have finally found a solution that can at least alleviate the second problem. So let's see how to use an up-to-date Mendeley reference list -- that is generated automatically -- in R Studio when you write your article in R markdown.

1. Set up Mendeley BibTeX syncing in Mendeley desktop
I don't exactly know when this option became available, but I have completely missed it. It is pretty straightforward. You just go to Tools/Options/BibTeX, and enable BibTeX syncing for your whole library. You should specify a path where the .bib file will be kept, and you are done. This file will contain ALL your Mendeley references, and will be automatically updated whenever you make a change in Mendeley.

2. Set up your R markdown document in R studio
You will need the citr package which is an R studio plugin.

```{r}
#install.packages("citr")
library(citr)
```

You have to specify the citation file path 

#Specify citation format

3. Now you are all set up to add citations!
# Start writing you document. Add citations using the Rstudio hotkey ...

4. The bibliography is automatically added to the compiled document
